In this problem, we are going to analysis some data (Superhero.dat) relating to childrenâ€™s injuries while wearing superhero costumes. Children reporting to the emergency center at hospitals had the severity of their injury (injury) assessed (on a scale from 0, no injury, to 100, death). In addition, a note was taken of which superhero costume they were wearing (hero): Spiderman (1), Superman (2), the Hulk (3) or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (4).

(a) Read the data `superhero.dat` by using `read_tsv` from `tidyverse`.
```{r}
LibraryList<-c("tidyverse", "modelr", "ggplot2", "dplyr")
for (TheLibrary in LibraryList)
{
  if(TheLibrary %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) install.packages(TheLibrary)
}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(modelr)
library(ggplot2)

superhero<-read_tsv("superhero.dat")
head(superhero)

```

(b) Recode the costume labels and make the variable a "factor".
```{r}
# Spiderman (1), Superman (2), the Hulk (3) or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (4)
#superhero$hero<-as.factor(superhero$hero)
superhero<-superhero %>% mutate(hero=recode_factor(hero, '1'="Spiderman", '2'="Superman", '3'="the Hulk", '4'="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle"))
superhero$hero

```

(c) Run a linear regression model to predict level of injury.
```{r}

(fit<-lm(injury~hero, data=superhero))


```

(d)) Draw some boxplots to show the injury severity for each superhero costumes.
```{r}

ggplot(superhero, aes(x=hero, y=injury, fill=hero)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_boxplot()

```
