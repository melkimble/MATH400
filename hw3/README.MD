You will need to answer the questions in the Rmd files, commit the changes and push the changes to github.

You are allowed to work individually or in a group of two people. If you have decided to work in a group, you would need to partner with different people for the future homework (except for the final project).

Besides the Rmd files, you also need to `knit` the Rmd files to html files and push them to github.
